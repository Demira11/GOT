# Game of Thrones Fan Page

You've been tasked with building a Game of Thrones fan page, featuring your favorite characters and a short bio for each one. You can't truly honor the Queen of Dragons with a static HTML/CSS page. You need to add some interactivity!

## Prerequisites

* The DOM
* Events and event listeners

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
2. Change into the new directory.
3. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## Requirements

The starter code has been provided for you. `index.html` and `style.css` include the initial structure and styling. In `script.js`, you will find an array of objects with each character's name and bio.

1. Add a button to each character's `div` that prints the name of each character to the console.
2. Add more functionality to the button: when clicked, the bio of the character appears under their image.
3. Add an input field at the top of the page. As the user types the character's name, only the character that was entered into the input field should remain.
4. Using an event listener, add a border around each character's `div` when the mouse is hovered over it.
5. Alive or Dead?

## Bonus

Add some additional features. Create a button that when clicked, arranges all characters in alphabetical order. Then, create another button that randomly shuffles the characters.
